# Task Manager

This Task Manager is a console-based application built in Kotlin, allowing users to add, remove, and list tasks. It serves as my first major project in my Personal Software Portfolio, demonstrating my ability to work with a new programming language and create a functional application.

As a software engineer from Ghana, I created this project to master Kotlinâ€™s syntax, including data classes, loops, and functions, while building a practical tool for task management. The app reflects my commitment to learning modern programming languages for tech solutions.
