# Overview

This Task Manager is a console-based application built in Kotlin, allowing users to add, remove, list, clear, and update task statuses. It demonstrates Kotlin’s core features, including data classes, loops, functions, conditionals, and collections, while providing a practical tool for task management.

As a software engineer from Ghana, my purpose was to master Kotlin’s syntax and object-oriented programming concepts to build efficient, modern applications. This project enhances my skills in developing robust software solutions for real-world use cases.
